# Site selection  

The aim of this script is to provide .geojson files to Planet to obtain access to high-resolution satellite data for the Nilgiris, Anamalais and parts of Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.  

## Load necessary libraries
```{r}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(mapview)
library(mapedit)
library(purrr)
library(terra)
library(spatstat.random)

# for plotting
library(viridis)
library(colorspace)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(fastmap)
```


## Load the Western Ghats outline and edit it interactively

```{r}
wg <- st_read("data/spatial/WG.shp")
wg <- st_make_valid(wg)

# create bounding box/polygon interactively for the region of interest
# for the sake of this exercise, we created a bounding box that is larger than the total area required for sampling

# Run the following two lines if you haven't previously executed the same

bbox <- mapview(wg) %>%
 editMap()

# check if overall area is <15,000 sq.km
st_area(bbox$finished)/ 1000000

# create files for exporting
roi <- st_as_sf(bbox$finished) %>%
  `st_crs<-`(4326)

# exporting
st_write(roi, "data/spatial/nilgiris_anamalais.json",
         driver = "GeoJSON")
```

## Creating an interactive file to view the region of interest

```{r}
# to save this to a file 
# if you would like to share this with collaborators/colleagues

html_fl <- tempfile(tmpdir = getwd(), fileext = "interactive-visualization.html")

view <- mapview(wg, col.regions = "gray") +
  mapview(roi, col.regions = "red")

# create standalone .html
mapview::mapshot(view, url = html_fl)

view
